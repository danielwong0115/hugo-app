# Images Directory

Place your images in this directory to use them in your Hugo site.

## Usage

To reference an image in your markdown content:

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/your-image.jpg)
```

## Required Image

For the assignment, you need to add at least one image. Some suggestions:
- `profile.jpg` - Your profile photo
- `project-screenshot.png` - Screenshot of a project
- Any other relevant image

The second blog post currently references `/images/profile.jpg`, so you can either:
1. Add a file named `profile.jpg` to this directory, OR
2. Update the image reference in `content/posts/second-post.md` to match your image filename
